```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
cdata <- data[complete.cases(data),]
sbd <- aggregate(cdata$steps, by=list(cdata$date), FUN=sum)
colnames(sbd) <- c("date","steps")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
with(sbd, 
     hist(steps, main=paste('Total number of steps taken each day'), 
          xlab='Steps per day'))
mean(sbd$steps)
median(sbd$steps)
```
